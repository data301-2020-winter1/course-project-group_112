This dataset was created thanks to spotify and a playlist from PlaylistMachinery. This data contains 2000 songs across every genre and 6 different decades, with analysis of the qualities each song possesses as well as the overall popularity of the song. With 10 different observations per song many questions about music can be answered by this data. It was created as a fun dataset to look at unique links of music over time.
## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

While scowering the internet for databases to analyze, I was struggling to find interesting data, and questions I truly wanted answered. After looking a stumbled upon a music megaset, containing thousands of songs across generations and genres. I love music and became facinated with the data, which led to questions about people and music. Music culture is fascinating and finding links or trends in genres, society, artists, and generations can help explain what makes certain music more popular to each generation or how music influences peoples emotions. Music is always fun to work with and I believe building a dashboard would be exciting.
